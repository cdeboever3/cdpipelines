Testing
=========

Currently the testing mainly consists of passing dummy input into the functions
to make sure they execute and don't have silly typos or bugs. In time it would
be nice to get small test data that I can run through the pipelines but this is
difficult because that requires software to actually be installed and working
as well as all of the needed reference files.
